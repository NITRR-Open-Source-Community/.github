## Who are we?

We are the NIT Raipur Open Source Community (NOSC), a passionate group of individuals dedicated to the world of open source software. Our mission is to foster a culture of collaboration, learning, and innovation through open source projects and initiatives.

At NOSC, we believe in the power of open source to drive positive change, and we welcome contributors from all backgrounds and skill levels to join us in our journey.

## What do we do?

- **Open Source Projects:** We actively contribute to and maintain a variety of open source projects, covering a wide range of technologies and domains.

- **Community Engagement:** We engage with the larger open source community, both locally and globally, to exchange ideas, share knowledge, and learn from others.

## What do we NOT do?

- **Exclusivity:** We are an inclusive community that welcomes members from all backgrounds, and we do not discriminate based on gender, race, or any other factors.

- **Commercial Projects:** We primarily focus on open source projects for educational, research, and community-driven purposes, rather than commercial ventures.

- **Academic Research:** While we encourage learning and innovation, we are not primarily a research-focused organization.

Join NOSC today, and let's build a vibrant open source community together!
